# Detaching from Fork Network

This document explains how to detach this repository from the original fork network and make it a standalone repository.

## Why Detach?

This TypeScript implementation has diverged significantly from the original Python version:
- Complete rewrite in TypeScript
- Different architecture (multi-provider support, embeddings)
- Different use cases and features
- Separate development path

While we credit and link to the original, this is now a distinct project.

## Current Status

This repository is currently a fork of `stephenc222/example-graphrag-with-sqlite`:
- Shows "forked from stephenc222/example-graphrag-with-sqlite" on GitHub
- May show up in the fork network
- Pull requests default to the upstream repository

## How to Detach (GitHub UI Method)

⚠️ **Important**: Detaching from a fork network is a **permanent action** that cannot be undone. Make sure you want to do this before proceeding.

### Option 1: Contact GitHub Support (Official Method)

GitHub doesn't provide a UI button to detach forks. You need to contact support:

1. **Go to GitHub Support**: https://support.github.com/contact

2. **Select the appropriate category**:
   - Subject: Repository Settings
   - Category: Fork issues

3. **Provide the following information**:
   ```
   Subject: Request to detach fork from network

   Repository: KHAEntertainment/example-graphrag-with-sqlite
   Original fork: stephenc222/example-graphrag-with-sqlite

   Reason:
   This repository started as a fork but has been completely rewritten in TypeScript
   with significant architectural changes. It now serves a different purpose with:
   - Complete TypeScript conversion
   - Multi-provider AI support
   - Optional embedding layer
   - Different feature set and use cases

   The original Python implementation is preserved in reference/python-original/
   and properly credited in the README. This is now a standalone project that
   should not be associated with the original fork network.

   Please detach this repository from the fork network while preserving all
   commits, issues, and pull requests.
   ```

4. **Wait for GitHub Support** to process your request (usually 1-3 business days)

### Option 2: Create New Repository (Manual Method)

If you need to detach immediately, you can manually create a new repository:

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**:
   - Name: `example-graphrag-with-sqlite` (or new name)
   - Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license

2. **Change remote in local clone**:
   ```bash
   # Remove old remote
   git remote remove origin

   # Add new remote
   git remote add origin git@github.com:KHAEntertainment/NEW-REPO-NAME.git

   # Push all branches and tags
   git push -u origin --all
   git push -u origin --tags
   ```

3. **Update repository settings**:
   - Transfer issues (if any) manually
   - Update repository description
   - Set up branch protection rules

4. **Archive or delete the old fork**

**Downsides of this approach**:
- Loses GitHub-specific metadata (issues, PRs, discussions)
- Loses stars and watchers
- Breaks existing links
- More manual work

## After Detaching

Once detached (via either method):

1. ✅ **Repository shows as standalone** (no "forked from" label)
2. ✅ **Pull requests default to your repository**
3. ✅ **Not shown in the original fork network**
4. ✅ **Original attribution maintained** in README and git history
5. ✅ **All commits and history preserved**

## What We've Already Done

To prepare for detaching, we've already:

- ✅ Moved original Python code to `reference/python-original/`
- ✅ Updated main README with proper attribution to stephenc222
- ✅ Created comprehensive TypeScript documentation
- ✅ Linked to original repository in multiple places
- ✅ Maintained MIT license from original

## Maintaining Attribution

Even after detaching, we maintain proper attribution by:

1. **README.md** - Credits section prominently displays:
   - Link to original repository
   - Original author name
   - Description of original work

2. **reference/python-original/** - Preserves original code with its own README

3. **Git history** - All original commits preserved

4. **LICENSE.txt** - Maintains MIT license

5. **Documentation** - Multiple references to the original

## Timeline

**Before Detaching**:
- [x] Complete TypeScript conversion
- [x] Add new features (embeddings, multi-provider)
- [x] Move Python files to reference/
- [x] Update README with attribution
- [x] Document detaching process

**To Detach**:
- [ ] Contact GitHub Support OR create new repository
- [ ] Wait for detachment / complete migration
- [ ] Verify repository is standalone

**After Detaching**:
- [ ] Update repository description
- [ ] Announce in README if desired
- [ ] Continue development independently

## Recommendation

**Use Option 1 (GitHub Support)** because:
- ✅ Preserves all metadata
- ✅ Preserves stars/watchers
- ✅ Preserves existing links
- ✅ Official GitHub method
- ❌ Takes a few days

Only use Option 2 if you need immediate detachment and are willing to lose metadata.
